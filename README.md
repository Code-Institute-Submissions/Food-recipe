# Freds Recipes
 I have used many different technologies to create an online recipe website.
 The website allows users to view, edit, delete and create recipes.
 
###UX
The target audience of this website is for anyone who is looking to cook a meal
but is not too sure on what recipe to make. This site is very good
for these type of users as they will have a wide range of recipes to select from.
The user will have full access to all the ingredients, instructions and an image
so that they know exactly what to and what the recipe is meant to look like.
If the user decides that they would like to change something about the recipe, they would 
be able to do so as the website does allow each recipe to be edited.

###Features
Add a recipe - This can be done by clicking on the "Add Recipe"
option on the navbar.

Edit a Recipe - This can be done by clicking on a recipe of the users choice and clicking on the 
"EDIT" button on the bottom right. After this, the site will redirect the user to
a page which has a form on there with all the information pre-filled. The user 
will be able to change any information on any of the input boxes. 
Once this has been done, the "Update" button will need to be clicked on.
This will redirect the site to the Edited recipe. 

Delete a Recipe - This can be done by clicking on a recipe of the users choice and clicking on the 
"DELETE" button on the bottom right.

View a recipe - This can be done through the user going to the recipes page
by clicking on "recipes". Once the recipes page has loaded, a recipe 
will need to be chosen by clicking on the "CHECK ME OUT!" button. The recipe will then load.

###### Features to be implemented
1. A search bar to allow users to search for recipes.
2. Allow each user to have their own personal accounts.

### Technologies used
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Python
* MongoDB

###Testing 

I have done many different tests on the site to make sure that it is fully
functioning. 

###### Adding a new recipe:
1 Click on the "Add Recipe" option on the navbar.
